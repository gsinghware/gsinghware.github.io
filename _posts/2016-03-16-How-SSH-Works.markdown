title: How SSH works

I'll be talking about SSH or secure-shell today. SSH is a Internet protocol. It's a set of rules specifying how two computers securely communicate over an unsecure network, like the internet. It's widely used for system administration, such as performing software updates or software deployment on Unix/Linux machines.

SSH is based on Server/Client Architecture. SSH Server program must be installed on the remote computer and SSH client program must be installed on your computer. When you use SSH, you have access to the terminal screen/command line of the remote server computer.

Here is a list of SSH clients, software that you use to set-up connection to the SSH server, for all the popular Operating systems:

The SSH Protocol mainly consists of three components. **Authentication, Encryption and Integrity**:

1. User authentication – A way for system to identify users who are given or denied access the server. Access is either controlled through username and password set-up by an administrator on the remote server, or a cryptographic key generated by the user and shared with the server. Using a key-based access is more common, and you might already be familiar with this if you use github/bitbucket for version control of your software.

2. Data encryption – Data is encrypted such is it is garbage for everyone except for the intended recipients.

3. Data Integrity – This is guarantee that no one can modify information being sent from sender to receiver.
