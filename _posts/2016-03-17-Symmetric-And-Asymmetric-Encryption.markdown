title: Symmetric and Asymmetric Encryption

Information can be encrypted using symmetrical (AKA shared key or shared secret encryption) or asymmetrical schemes (AKA public-key cryptography).

**Symmetric Encryption** - In symmetrical encryption, the information is encrypted and decrypted using the same key. Anyone who holds the key can encrypt and decrypt messages and send them to anyone else who has the key. Algorithms that use symmetric encryption are Blowfish, Twofish, DES, 3DES, AES, and RC4.

**Asymmetric Encryption** - In asymmetrical encryption, the information is encrypted using a public key and decrypted using the private key. There is mathematical relationship between the public and the private key. The public key is shared with everyone and it reveals no information about the private key. The private key is kept in secret and whoever holds this key can decrypt the messages encrypted using the public key. Algorithms that use asymmetric encryption are: RSA, El Gamel, Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange and more...
