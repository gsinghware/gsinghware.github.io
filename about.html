  <h1>about me</h1>

  <p>
    Hey, I'm <strong>Gurpreet Singh</strong> &lt;<a href="mailto:gsinghbox@gmail.com">gsinghbox@gmail.com</a>&gt;, a student, a computer scientist and a technology enthusiastic. Currently, I am attending The City College of New York (<b>CCNY</b>) and perusing B.S. in Computer Science. I will graduate in May 2016.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have worked on projects in several areas of Computer Science, including Computer Vision, Image Processing, Information theory, Mobile Development (Android and Android wear), Data Visualization, Big Data Analytics and Management,  and Computer Security.
  </p>

  <p>
    I enjoy making software. Here are a few I'm proud of:

    <ul>
      <li><b><font color="red">Senior Capstone Project - CuraWatch</font></b> <b>[In-Progress]</b></li>

      I am leading a 4 member team and developing an assistive technology, CuraWatch, for community centers that provide services for autistic individuals. Our goal is to help individuals with staying focused, on task, and active in work environments so that they may better their chances for employment and other opportunities in the future. We have developed an Android Wear application that runs on a smartwatch that will be worn by an employee, and a tablet/phone that will be used by a manager/supervisor. The application provides messaging, calendar/tasks, and fitness tracking features so that organizations can oversee their employeesâ€™ daily activities and communicate information remotely, all of which can be done in a simulated work environment.</br></br>

      <li><b><font color="red">Pascal Compiler</font></b></li>
      I built a compiler for the pascal programming language in C++ while I was taking the Compiler construction course. A compiler comprises of several stages. I implemented the Scanning of the input program, parsing the program statements and building a stack machine to output the assembly instructions that are performed to get the output of the program. Some of the statements that were implemented in the compiler were: while, for, goto, repeat, if/else, assignment.</br></br>

     <li><b><font color="red"><a href="http://desiranker.com/">DesiRanker</a></font></b> <b>[In-Progress]</b></li>
      Desi Ranker is a platform designed to allow vistors to collaboratively vote on lists. The platform is written in the Object Oriented PHP MVC framework. The visitors can register and then create a list of their favorite movies. The movies are gathered using an API call to The Movie Database. </br></br>

      <li><b><font color="red">Online Book Store</font></b></li>
      I was leading a 2 member team to developed this application in my Software Engineering class. We were given the requirements for this application and we had to write up the software specifications. We used PHP & MySQL to make the website and allowed users to register to become booksellers or buyers, bid on books, and add comments. We stored all the data into a relational database system. </br></br>

 
      <li><b><font color="red">Cloud Weather States Dataset Visualization</font></b></li>
      This project was completed in my data visualization course. I built an interactive visualization using D3.js library to display how weather states changed thoughtout the years. I was given image dataset from a statellite from year 1983-2009. The data format was in ASCII. First step was to clean the data and structure it in a way so that it can be easily displayed on a web browser. After the data was structured and stored in a json format, I created a video visualization in which the users can select the year, month, and day that they would like to analyze and then the video would display how clouds moved thoughout the selected timeline. Python was used to clean and process the data. </br></br>

      <li><b><font color="red">Money Detection System</font></b></li>

      <li><b><font color="red">Simulating a 3D LED cube using OpenGL and Qt</font></b></li>

      <li><b><font color="red">Virtual Super Market web application using a javascript library, Three.Js</font></b></li>

    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>Here is list of technologies that I have used before:
    <ul>
      <li><b>Programming Languages</b>: C++/C, Java, Python, JavaScript, Bash, SQL, PHP, VHDL, Scheme, Pascal, VBA.NET, C#</li>
      <li><b>Software/Tools</b>: Amazon Web Services, Big Data, Hadoop, OpenCV, Python Libraries (Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, Basemap), Android Mobile/Wear Development, Dr. Racket, Qt and OpenGL, Quartus, ModelSim, Signal Processing, SolidWorks, JavaScript Libraries (Three.Js, D3.Js), Model View Controller (MVC), Apache Web Server, MySQL, MongoDB, Express.JS, Angular JS, Node JS, Mercurial/Git, Version Control, Linux, Mac OS, Windows, GCC, Microsoft Visual Studio.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
