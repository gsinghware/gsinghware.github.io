  <h1>Bio</h1>

  <p>"Men of few words are the best men." - William Shakespeare, Henry V</p>

  <p>
    I'm <strong>Gurpreet Singh</strong> &lt;<a href="mailto:gsinghbox@gmail.com">gsinghbox@gmail.com</a>&gt;, a programmer, student, and a computer scientist.
  </p>

  <p>
  	I currently live in New York. I study Computer Science at The City College of New York (CCNY). I will graduate in June 2016. 
  </p>

  <p>
  	I like to play chess (not very good at it), read about world history, and watch anime and sports (cricket, soccer, etc). I think Tendulkar is the greatest cricketer and Ronaldo is the greatest footballer ever. I also like rap music, and the Legendary Eminem is my favorite rap artist.
  </p>

  <p>ok, bye.
