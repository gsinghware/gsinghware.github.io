  <p>I’ll be talking about SSH or secure-shell today. SSH is a Internet protocol. It’s a set of rules specifying how two computers securely communicate over an unsecure network, like the internet. It’s widely used for system administration, such as performing software updates or software deployment on Unix/Linux machines.</p>

<p>SSH is based on Server/Client Architecture. SSH Server program must be installed on the remote computer and SSH client program must be installed on your computer.</p>

<p>When you use SSH, you have access to the terminal screen/command line of the remote server computer. Here is a list of SSH clients that you use to set-up connection to the SSH server:</p>

<p><img src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-wDtfx8AKLFI/VuovT8wt-aI/AAAAAAAACbk/-vlfF7YShUU0ioLYrEi9ZvKiFKzEX844g/s320/SSH-OS-Clients.png" alt="alt text" title="SSH OS Clients" /></p>

<p>The SSH Protocol mainly consists of three components. <strong>Authentication, Encryption and Integrity</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>User authentication</strong> – A way for system to identify users who are given or denied access the server. Access is either controlled through username and password set-up by an administrator on the remote server, or a cryptographic key generated by the user and shared with the server. Using a key-based access is more common, and you might already be familiar with this if you use github/bitbucket for version control of your software.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Data encryption</strong> – Data is encrypted such is it is garbage for everyone except for the intended recipients.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Data Integrity</strong> – This is guarantee that no one can modify information being sent from sender to receiver.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>SSH Features</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Secure Remote Logins</strong> - SSH allows secure remote login to the server by using an encrypted connection by using a ssh client program that authenticates you to the remote computer’s SSH server. This means your username and password are encrypted locally first and then they are transmitted. If authenticated successfully, any packets which follow are encrypted using the SSH protocol.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Secure File Transfer</strong> – Using SSH, a file that may contain sensitive information can be transmitted securely between machines with scp command.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Remotely execute commands</strong> - Using the SSH connection, you can execute commands externally on the remote server computer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Port Forwarding</strong> - SSH can secure other unsecure TCP/IP protocols such as FTP, telnet using port forwarding techniques. For example one can use telnet protocol over SSH connection.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>SSH Encryption and Connection</strong></p>

<p>To establish a connection with the SSH server, the SSH client begins with a TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) handshake. The diagram below shows the process of TCP handshake:</p>

<p><img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-TtdPdAgpl6Q/VurepyZUtqI/AAAAAAAACb4/Ha9spm2FY34anF2n59BGLgHcUCD_NVTjA/s1600/tcp-handshake.png" alt="alt text" title="TCP Handshake" /></p>

<p>After the connection is established, both the client and server agree on public parameters and generate their own private key and use the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange algorithm to establish a session-key. See diffie-hellman algorithm. This session-key will be used to ecrypt the entire session.</p>

<p>After the session-key is established, the user authentication will begin. The user authentication can be done using passwords or using SSH key pairs as metioned earlier in the SSH features section.</p>

<p>If you use password authenctication, the server will prompt the client for the password of the account they try to access. The password is encrypted by the client and sent, and once recieved by the server decrypts the password and verifies it. If the password is correct, then the client is given access to the account.</p>
